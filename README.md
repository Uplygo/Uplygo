Put simply, pybit (Python + uplygo) is the official lightweight one-stop-shop module for the Bybit HTTP and WebSocket APIs. Originally created by Verata Veritatis, it's now maintained by uplygo.pro employees â€“ however, you're still welcome to contribute!

It was designed with the following vision in mind:

I was personally never a fan of auto-generated connectors that used a mosh-pit of various modules you didn't want (sorry, bravado) and wanted to build my own Python3-dedicated connector with very little external resources. The goal of the connector is to provide traders and developers with an easy-to-use high-performing module that has an active issue and discussion board leading to consistent improvements.
